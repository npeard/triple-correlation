## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a breakthrough method for **ab initio phase retrieval** from intensity triple correlations of incoherent light sources. For the first time, this work solves the long-standing **sign problem** in closure phase determination, enabling complete Fourier inversion and direct image reconstruction of arbitrary arrays of independent emitters using only far-field intensity correlations.

## The Phase Problem Revolution

Traditional coherent diffractive imaging faces a fundamental challenge: phase information is lost when measuring intensities with photodetectors. While second-order intensity correlations (Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect) can reveal Fourier amplitudes, retrieving the phase from the triple correlations to enable complete image reconstruction has remained elusive for **over 60 years** since the discovery of closure phases in the 1960s.

**This work finally cracks the code.**

### üåü **Applications Across Fields**
- **Astronomy**: Imaging star clusters with radio telescope arrays
- **X-ray Science**: Fluorescence imaging without lenses
- **Microscopy**: High-resolution imaging of fluorescent molecules and atoms
- **Quantum Optics**: Many-body correlations in ultracold atomic gases

### üöÄ **Technical Breakthroughs**
- Novel numerical algorithm using redundant closure phase information
- Sophisticated error minimization approach for noisy data
- Enhanced spatial resolution beyond detector physical limits
- Memory-efficient computation for large detector arrays

## Key Results

Our simulations demonstrate:
- ‚úÖ Accurate phase retrieval for clusters of several atoms with only 10‚Å¥ shots
- ‚úÖ Complete image reconstruction without coherent diffraction data
- ‚úÖ Phase information retrieval beyond physical detector boundaries

## The Science Behind It

The method leverages **third-order intensity correlations** (bispectrum) to extract closure phases:

$$\Phi(\vec{m},\vec{n}) = \pm[\phi(\vec{m}+\vec{n}) - \phi(\vec{m}) - \phi(\vec{n})]$$

The breakthrough lies in using redundant information to constrain the sign ambiguity (¬±), enabling complete phase recovery through:

1. **Intersection Algorithm**: Finding common values among multiple sign-ambiguous solutions
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Correcting early pixel errors to maintain global consistency
