# TriPhaser
Simulation of fluorescence/speckle intensity correlations and phase retrieval from the triple correlations as described in [this paper](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-31-15-25082&id=532719).

The core simulation code is in Speckle_1D/2D files. 

Plots of simulation data are written in Plot_1D/2D files. These plots are executed from main.py.

Phase retrieval algorithms are in the TriPhase_1D/TriPhase_2D files.
